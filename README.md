I build backend systems that scale. With 4+ years of production experience, I specialize in **Elixir/Phoenix** for high-concurrency, fault-tolerant services — from real-time dashboards with LiveView to GraphQL APIs handling enterprise workloads.

Currently building at the intersection of **backend infrastructure and AI governance**, where reliability and auditability are non-negotiable.

Most of my production work lives in private repositories — the systems I've shipped include chargeback resolution platforms, inventory optimization engines, microservices architectures, and multi-tenant SaaS products serving thousands of concurrent users.

## Technical Focus

**Primary Stack**
- **Elixir / Phoenix / Phoenix LiveView** — production systems, real-time features, OTP design patterns
- **GraphQL** — schema design, resolver optimization, efficient data fetching
- **Node.js** (Express, NestJS) · **.NET Core** — polyglot backend work

**Frontend**
- **React / React Native** — full product delivery including App Store & Play Store deployments
- TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Redux

**Data & Infrastructure**
- PostgreSQL · Redis · MySQL
- AWS (S3, SQS, SNS) · Docker · CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- RabbitMQ · Event-driven architecture · Microservices

**AI Development Tooling**
- Daily driver of **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, OpenCode**
- Integrating AI tooling into real development workflows — not as a crutch, but as a force multiplier for complex implementations

---

## What I Work On

- **Enterprise backend systems** — high-volume transaction processing, workflow automation, real-time data pipelines
- **AI governance infrastructure** — building systems where AI decisions need to be auditable, traceable, and controllable
- **Developer tooling & architecture** — clean API design, scalable schemas, observable services

---

## Background

- 4+ years across enterprise and startup environments
- Experience leading technical internship programs and mentoring developers
- Comfortable owning full delivery: architecture → implementation → deployment → monitoring
- Working in English-speaking, cross-functional teams for 3+ years

---

## Currently Exploring

- Advanced OTP patterns and distributed Elixir
- AI agent infrastructure and governance tooling
- Production observability with Datadog and structured logging
