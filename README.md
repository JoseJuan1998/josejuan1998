### Hey there, I'm Jose Juan 👋

I'm a backend engineer based in Morelia, Mexico 🇲🇽 — currently building infrastructure for an **AI governance startup** while staying deep in the world of **Elixir, Phoenix, and distributed systems**.

I've spent the last 4+ years shipping production systems that handle real load: real-time financial dashboards, multi-tenant SaaS platforms, inventory optimization engines, mobile apps on the App Store and Play Store. Most of that work lives in private repos — but the craft transfers.

When I'm not wiring up GenServers or designing GraphQL schemas, I'm thinking about how AI tooling is reshaping the way we write software — and actively using those tools every day.

### 🚀 What I'm into right now

- Building auditable, trustworthy AI systems at the infrastructure level
- Pushing the limits of Phoenix LiveView for real-time UX
- Exploring how AI-assisted development fits into serious engineering workflows — not as a shortcut, but as a genuine multiplier
